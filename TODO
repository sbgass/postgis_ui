Bugs: transformed_geometries are not persisted in map or Database 
    - On Apply: clear DB, session_state, and write results to sidebar, db, session_state
    - "last_active_drawing" instead of all_drawings synced to DB. Only clear DB when Apply button is clicked. 
Features: Draw geom on map from WKT. 
    - New text box and button in sidebar before rendering map. Adds to db, session_state.
